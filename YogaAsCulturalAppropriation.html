      <h1> Yoga in America is an example of Cultural Appropriation</h1>
    </p>
    <h2> What is Yoga to Hindus?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 26px"> We can begin to answer this question with examples. For Hindus yoga is a way to be close to brahman.
    The Webster Dictionary Defines Yoga as "a Hindu theistic philosophy teaching the suppression of all activity of body, 
    mind, and will in order that the self may realize its distinction from them and attain 
    liberation." We also see in the website HinduAmerican.org  "Most Hindu texts discuss yoga as a practice to control the senses and ultimately, 
    the mind. The most famous is the Bhagavad Gita (dating back to 6th-3rd Century BCE), in which Krishna speaks of four types of yoga – bhakti, or devotion; 
    jnana, or knowledge; karma, or action; and dhyana, or concentration (often referred to as raja yoga, though not all sources agree on the term) 
    – as paths to achieve moksha, the ultimate goal according to Hindu understanding." </p>

  <p style="font-size: 26px"> It is defined in the article given to us by Dr. Barnsley as the process of a dominant culture manipulating aspects of a marginalized culture for 
    its benefit. </p>

  <h2>How Does America Culturally Appropriate Yoga ?</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 26px"> 
    Americans as they practice Yoga do not tie in the cultural and spiritual importance that Yoga actually conveys. Instead they use yoga 
    a mere past time or a way to get some physical activity in. They focus on purely the physical aspects of Yoga and completely disregard 
    the spiritual importance of it.

  <h2> Corporate Yoga ? </h2>
  <p style="font-size: 26px"> Yoga in America is not focused on the spiritual benefits of it. Instead it is focused on money because it is a very profitable industry. 
  Big brands have come around such as LuluLemon that profit off of Yoga. We also have entire studios built to practice Yoga. It is a very profitable industry 
  with even Yoga instructors being able to make a good living. </p>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p style="font-size: 26px"> 
Yoga is culturally appropriated. For Hindus it is a way to reach some of their spiritual needs and attain liberation from the body. 
It is very important for them spiritually, but for many Americans it is just a way to be physically active. In fact many Americans see Yoga 
as a way to make money. We have big name companies like LuluLemon and many studios dedicated to Yoga. We also have Yoga instructors making a living. Even 
if Hindus have given their blessings to practice Yoga in America it should still be taught what the purpose of it is. It should not be seen as a money maker 
and it should not be just another hobby.  </p>
